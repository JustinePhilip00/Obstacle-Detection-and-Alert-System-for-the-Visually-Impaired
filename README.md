The main objective behind the project was to help visually impaired while on the roads. 
Since there arenâ€™t much safety systems available for the visually impaired in the market right now, this project seemed interesting and needful

Working:
The basic working of the project is that the ultrasonic sensors detect for obstacles, the formula designed calculates the distance between the obstacle and the person. The vibration motor vibrates when the object is near(less than or equal to 15cm).
